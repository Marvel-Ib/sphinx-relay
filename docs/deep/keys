There are a couple of keys to keep in mind of in Sphinx

auth_token: This is how your relay knows its you asking for a request
node pub_key: This is your pubkey on the lightning network, this is how users know where to keysend
node pri_key: This is your private key keep this safe
transport_token: This is a token generated by your node so that you are not just pasting your auth_token in plain text and trusting tls to protect your token
exported_keys: This is your recovry mechanism with this format `base64(keys::Encrypt("<sk>::<pk>::<ip>::<auth_token>", pin))`
contact_key: this is the key other users use to send you an encrypted message
pin: what you use to encrypt you exported_keys
